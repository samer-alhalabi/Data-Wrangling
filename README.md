# Data-Wrangling

Data wrangling, sometimes referred to as data munging, is the process of transforming and mapping data from one "raw" data form into another format with the intent of making it more appropriate and valuable for a variety of downstream purposes such as analytics. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_wrangling)

##### Data wrangling involves processing the data in various formats like - merging, grouping, concatenating etc. for the purpose of analysing or getting them ready to be used with another set of data. Python has built-in features to apply these wrangling methods to various data sets to achieve the analytical goal. In this repo, I will show few examples describing these methods.
